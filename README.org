#+title: Scala Concurrent Lettercount

Wrote this last year as part of an assignment, uploading now to include in CV.
Counts all a-z letters in a file, including uppercase and lowercase in the same count.
Works using [[https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/index.html][Acca Actors]]  and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce][MapReduce]] model.

Takes ~90s to count all letters in a ~5GB version of Bleak House on a Ryzen 9 5950X CPU.

Run with ~sbt run~

Arguments:
 1. File to count letters in
 2. Amount of time to wait before calling an error
